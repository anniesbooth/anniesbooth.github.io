I'm an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at NC State.  I specialize in surrogate modeling of computer experiments including uncertainty quantification, active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reliability analysis.  My recent focus has been on developing deep Gaussian processes as surrogate models; I maintain the open-source [deepgp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=deepgp) R-package on CRAN.   

I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics at Virginia Tech in 2023, where I was advised by [Bobby Gramacy](https://bobby.johnson-gramacy.com/) and [Dave Higdon](https://www.stat.vt.edu/people/stat-faculty/higdon-david.html).  My Ph.D. dissertation was recently selected as a finalist for the [2023 Savage Award](https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/).
