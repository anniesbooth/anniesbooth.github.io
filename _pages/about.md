I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Virginia Tech.  Previously, I was an Assistant Professor of Statistics at NC State University.  I earned my Ph.D. in Statistics at Virginia Tech in 2023, and my Ph.D. dissertation was recently selected as a finalist for the [2023 Savage Award](https://bayesian.org/project/savage-award/).  I specialize in surrogate modeling of computer experiments including uncertainty quantification, active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reliability analysis.  My recent focus has been on developing deep Gaussian processes as surrogate models; I maintain the open-source [deepgp](https://cran.r-project.org/package=deepgp) R-package on CRAN.   

> **_NOTE:_** I previously published under my maiden name, Annie Sauer.

News and Highlights
